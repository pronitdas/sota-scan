# sota-scan

### Is your project as good as the best out there? Find out.

Point it at your project. It asks one thing:

> **"What do the best projects have that I don't?"**

It checks the top real projects in your space. Compares them to yours. Hands you a scorecard and a to-do list.

Every gap points to a real project that already does it. No vague advice. No fluff.

---

## Why it's good

🪞 **An honest mirror.** Where you really stand.

🎯 **A fair fight.** It sorts projects by approach. It compares you to your real peers. Not a random pile. Borrowed ideas from other styles are marked optional, never counted against you.

🧾 **Receipts, not opinions.** Every gap names a real project.

✅ **A real to-do list.** Ranked. Worst first. With a next step.

📈 **Tracks progress.** Run it again. See what improved.

## Try it (2 min)

It's an add-on for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) **or [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)**. Pick your tool:

### Claude Code

Copy two files in:

**Mac / Linux**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/sota-scan ~/.claude/workflows
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/sota-scan/
cp workflows/sota-scan-fanout.js ~/.claude/workflows/
```

**Windows**
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force ~/.claude/skills/sota-scan, ~/.claude/workflows | Out-Null
Copy-Item SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/sota-scan/
Copy-Item workflows/sota-scan-fanout.js ~/.claude/workflows/
```

### OpenCode

OpenCode has no Workflow runtime, so the port uses its own skill (`opencode/SKILL.md`) and runs the clustering as a real Node script (`cluster-cli.mjs`) instead of inlining it. Copy three files in:

**Mac / Linux**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/sota-scan/lib
cp opencode/SKILL.md   ~/.config/opencode/skills/sota-scan/SKILL.md
cp cluster-cli.mjs     ~/.config/opencode/skills/sota-scan/
cp lib/cluster.mjs     ~/.config/opencode/skills/sota-scan/lib/
```

The two non-exhaustive modes run identically to Claude Code. In `exhaustive` mode the port fans out one `Task` subagent per competitor and pipes their profiles through `cluster-cli.mjs` for deterministic peer-grouping and tier scoring. Requires Node and the `Task` tool; without them it falls back to a sequential inline scan and says so.

---

Open your tool in any project. Say:

```
/sota-scan
```

Or just ask:

- *"Is my project top-tier?"*
- *"What am I missing vs the best?"*

Done. It does the rest.

---

## How deep?

| Say | You get | For |
|---|---|---|
| `/sota-scan quick` | top 3 gaps | a fast check |
| `/sota-scan` | full scorecard | everyday use |
| `/sota-scan exhaustive` | the deepest scan | launch / investor ready |

**First time? Start with `quick`.** Cheap, fast taste. Go deeper once you like it.

---

## What it costs

It does real research — reads a dozen competitor projects, not just summaries. So it's not instant or free:

| Mode | Roughly |
|---|---|
| `quick` | ~80–150k tokens · a minute or two |
| `standard` | ~150–350k tokens · a few minutes |
| `exhaustive` | ~400k+ tokens · several minutes |

Use it now and then — before a launch, a pitch, or when you're curious — not on every commit. On a Claude plan it's bundled. Paying per token? Lean on `quick`.

---

## Good to know

- Needs **Claude Code** or **OpenCode** with internet.
- It won't tell you to pivot. Just how to win at what you already do.
- It scanned itself and came out top-tier. Proof in [`.sota/`](.sota/).
