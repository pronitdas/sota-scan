# sota-scan — benchmark this repo against the field

You answer one question with evidence: **"What do the best projects in this domain have that we don't?"**

The job is **grounded comparison**, not a generic best-practices listicle. Every gap you report must be tied to (a) something real in _this_ repo and (b) a real online source. No source → no claim.

## Execution modes

Pick a mode before Step 1 and **state which mode you're running in one line** at the top of the output. Default to `standard` unless the user explicitly signals otherwise.

| Mode         | Comparators      | Saturation                                                 | Output                               |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `quick`      | 3–5              | none (early stop)                                          | top 3 gaps only                      |
| `standard`   | 5–10             | light — vary terms until no obvious new comparator appears | full dashboard                       |
| `exhaustive` | 10+ where useful | strict — two consecutive no-new-finding rounds             | full dashboard + persisted artifacts |

- Use **`quick`** when the user asks for a fast/rough check ("quick look", "ballpark", "are we roughly competitive"). Always **disclose the early stop** — don't imply the field is complete.
- Use **`standard`** by default: inspect the repo, scan 5–10 comparators, vary search terms until no obvious new comparator surfaces, render the full dashboard.
- Use **`exhaustive`** when the user asks for a _serious_ benchmark — investor/release-readiness, blocker audit, "do this properly", "leave nothing out". Scan 10+ comparators, require two empty saturation rounds (Step 1), and always persist the artifacts (Step 4).

### Exhaustive mode — delegate the fan-out to a Workflow

A prompt runs sequentially: in `quick`/`standard` you fetch comparators one at a time, which is fine at 3–10. At 10+ that serial fetch is the bottleneck. So `exhaustive` mode **hands the fan-out to the `sota-scan-fanout` Workflow**, which analyzes every comparator concurrently. The split is deliberate — discovery stays here, parallel analysis goes there, persistence comes back here:

1. **Discover inline (Step 1).** Run the saturation loop yourself — discovery is iterative (each round's queries depend on the last), so it doesn't parallelize. Produce a **broad candidate pool** `[{repo, url, type}]` — aim for **50+** when the domain supports it, since the workflow clusters them into peer groups.
2. **Build the Us inventory inline (Step 0)** as `[{id, name, status, file}]`, and a one-object **Us profile** `{primary_domain, methodology, target_user, feature_categories:[…], cluster_label}` (Step 1.5) so the workflow can classify our repo into a cluster.
3. **Call the Workflow**, passing both plus any saved rubric and today's date:
   `Workflow({ name: "sota-scan-fanout", args: { domain, comparators, rubric: <saved or null>, us: <inventory>, us_profile: <profile or null>, now: "<today>" } })`
   It **profiles** every candidate (rich metadata + capabilities), **clusters** them into peer groups deterministically (`lib/cluster.mjs`), **classifies** our repo into the closest cluster, picks **direct vs. reference** repos, then synthesizes and **returns** `{ domain, clusters, user_cluster, selection, selection_explanation, field, rubric, matrix, coverage, tier, gaps_total, gaps:{direct_peer, maturity, onboarding, cross_cluster} }`.
4. **You persist and render (Step 4 + output shape).** The Workflow has **no filesystem access** — it returns data, it never writes. Take its return value, write `.sota/rubric.<domain>.json` and `.sota/last-scan.json` (or the read-only fallback), diff against the prior scan, and render the dashboard. All persistence logic lives here in exactly one place, so read-only handling is identical across modes.

If the Workflow tool is unavailable (e.g. headless run), fall back to a sequential `exhaustive` scan inline and disclose that the fan-out was skipped.

### Source quality — prefer primary, verify in code

When more than one source could back a claim, prefer in this order:

1. competitor repo **code**
2. official **docs**
3. release notes / changelog
4. package-registry metadata
5. first-party blog posts
6. secondary articles

**Do not use a README marketing claim alone to assert a table-stakes gap when code or docs can verify it.** "Their README says they have X" is not confirmation that they have X — confirm in code/docs before scoring it against us.

### Read-only fallback

If write access is unavailable (chat preview, CI sandbox, external-repo review), **do not fail.** Render `.sota/rubric.<domain-slug>.json` and `.sota/last-scan.json` as copyable JSON blocks in the output and mark persistence as **"not written — read-only environment."** The scan still completes; only the on-disk record is deferred to the user.

## Step 0 — Read us before reading them

Before any web search, build a short **capability inventory of the current repo** from its own evidence:

- Read `README*`, top-level docs, `Cargo.toml`/`package.json`/manifests, and the main entry modules.
- Extract: the repo's stated goal/domain, its concrete features, its tech stack, and its claimed differentiators.
- Write this as a bullet list. This is the left column of every later comparison. **Each capability you claim for _us_ must name the file/feature backing it** (e.g. `✅ secrets gate — bin/anvil/Gate.ps1`) — the "Us" side is held to the same cite-it bar as the SOTA side.
- **Pick the field deliberately — this is the highest-leverage decision in the whole scan; the wrong field invalidates the entire matrix.** If the repo straddles 2–3 adjacent fields (e.g. "git-hook manager" _and_ "quality-gate platform" _and_ "AI-output verifier"), name each one in a single line and pull table-stakes from all of them rather than forcing one. If the domain is genuinely ambiguous, state your assumption in one line and continue (don't stall on it).

## Step 1 — Find the field

Search the web and GitHub for the **5–10 most relevant comparable projects** in that domain (prefer active, well-starred, or canonical repos). Use the deferred `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` tools (load them via ToolSearch first). For each candidate:

- Fetch its README / docs / feature list.
- Note: name, URL, star/activity signal, and its headline capabilities.
- **Tag a comparator _type_, not just popularity** — stars alone bias the field toward marketing reach. Classify each as one of: `canonical` (defines the expected workflow), `popular` (widely-adopted baseline), `technically advanced` (best implementation of some capability), `niche-relevant` (small but directly comparable), or `stale-reference` (matters historically but inactive/archived). A 2k-star `technically advanced` repo can set the bar higher than a 28k-star `popular` one — the type is what justifies inclusion.
- **Get hard numbers, not scraped guesses.** If `gh` is available, pull exact stars, last-push date, and archived status with `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '{stars:.stargazers_count, pushed:.pushed_at, archived:.archived}'` (or `gh search repos`). Only fall back to web-scraped "~Nk" figures when `gh` is unavailable — and mark them `~` so the reader knows they're soft.
- **Recency is part of SOTA.** A capability "matched" by a repo last pushed years ago, or `archived: true`, is not state-of-the-art — flag such comparators rather than treating them as the bar.

Cast wide enough to cover the domain's table-stakes, not just the first repo you find.

**Search to saturation, not to a fixed count.** One pass over the first 5–10 hits can miss the actual SOTA leader and anchor the whole matrix on the wrong field. Keep searching — vary the query angle (by capability, by competitor name, by "X alternatives", by the academic/term-of-art name) — until **two consecutive rounds surface no new comparator and no new table-stakes capability.** Only then is the field mapped. If you stop early for cost, say so in one line rather than implying the field is complete.

**For broad domains, cast a wide candidate POOL, not a shortlist.** When the domain is broad (e.g. "context management", "auth", "observability", "agent frameworks", "scraping", "ETL", "databases", "UI libraries"), the best-known repos often represent _different approaches_ that are not fair peers — fuzzy file search vs. vector database vs. knowledge graph all live under "context management." Gather a **broad pool (aim for 50+ when the domain supports it)** so Step 1.5 can cluster them; you'll benchmark mostly within one cluster, not against the whole undifferentiated set.

## Step 1.5 — Cluster the field into peer groups, then place us

**The core fairness move.** A focused repo must not be penalized for lacking features that belong to a _different_ methodology in the same broad space. So before scoring, split the pool into clusters and find which one we actually belong to.

The deterministic contract lives in **`lib/cluster.mjs`** (and is inlined into the `sota-scan-fanout` workflow). In `exhaustive` mode the workflow runs this for you. In `quick`/`standard` mode you do it inline, by hand, following the same shape:

1. **Profile each candidate** — extract: `repo`, `url`, short `description`, `readme_summary`, `primary_domain`, **`methodology`/architecture**, `target_user`, **`feature_categories`** (3–6 tags), and maturity signals (`stars`, last commit, docs, tests, examples, releases).
2. **Assign a `cluster_label`** — a **broad methodology FAMILY** in kebab-case (e.g. `fuzzy-file-search`, `vector-database`, `classic-knowledge-graph`, `deep-research-agent`). Pick the _most generic family that fits_ (1–3 words), based on **how it works** — repos sharing a methodology must share the label even if their stacks differ. Avoid hyper-specific per-repo labels (`langgraph-super-agent-harness`); they fragment the field. (In `exhaustive` mode the candidates are profiled in parallel with no shared view, so this discipline matters most there — coarse families cluster, bespoke labels don't.)
3. **Cluster** by grouping equal/synonymous labels (group by label; absorb a stray 1–2 member label into the canonical cluster whose feature tokens contain it).
4. **Classify us** into the closest cluster — by matching our own `cluster_label`, else by methodology/feature-tag overlap. Record a confidence and the reason.
5. **Select comparators**: **direct** = members of our cluster (ranked by maturity); **broader references** = the top 1–2 of each _other_ cluster; everything else is **excluded** background. This is what the matrix and table-stakes gaps are scored against.
6. **Degrade gracefully.** Fewer than ~50 repos, a thin pool, or no confident cluster → fall back to one flat peer group ranked by maturity, and **say so** ("no distinct peer cluster — compared against the whole field"). Never block on the 50 target.

The output must keep three claims distinct and never conflate them:

- **"Your direct peers usually have this"** → a real, mandatory gap (direct-peer / maturity / onboarding section).
- **"Top projects in the broader space have this"** → context, not necessarily a gap for _you_.
- **"This is a strategic idea borrowed from another cluster"** → optional cross-cluster inspiration, **never** a mandatory missing feature.

## Step 2 — Build the capability matrix

### Field framing (required, render before the matrix)

The highest-risk failure mode is benchmarking the repo against the _wrong kind of project_. Make the framing auditable so the reader can catch a bad call before trusting the matrix:

```
### Field framing
Detected domain:           <domain>
Detected cluster:          <our peer cluster> (confidence <high/med/low>) — <one-line why>
Clusters found:            <clusterA (n)>, <clusterB (n)>, …
Direct comparators:        <owner/repo, owner/repo, …>  (same cluster — what we're scored against)
Broader references:        <owner/repo [clusterB], …>   (other clusters — context, not gaps)
Adjacent domains considered: <domain A>, <domain B>
Excluded domains:          <domain C> — <why it's out of scope>
Benchmark assumption:      <one sentence the whole matrix rests on>
```

If the repo genuinely straddles fields, name each detected domain rather than forcing one. **The matrix is scored against the DIRECT cluster** — capabilities that only exist in other clusters are cross-cluster ideas (Step 3), not matrix rows.

Produce one table. Rows = capabilities **our direct cluster** expects (derived from Step 1.5's direct comparators, not invented). Columns:

| Capability | Us  | SOTA (who has it) | Gap? | Reference |
| ---------- | --- | ----------------- | ---- | --------- |

- **Us** = ✅ have it / ⚠️ partial / ❌ missing, grounded in your Step 0 inventory.
- **SOTA** = which real repo(s) demonstrate it.
- **Gap?** = blank / **table-stakes** (everyone serious has it) / _edge_ (nice-to-have).
- **Reference** = a real `owner/repo`. Point to a specific _file_ (`comp/liq-bot → src/markets/compound.rs`) **only if you actually confirmed that path** (via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/...`, repo browse, or the docs naming it). If you only confirmed the repo/feature exists but not the exact file, cite `owner/repo → <feature name>` — do **not** invent a plausible file path, that breaks the no-guessing rule. Never leave this empty.

### Score against a fixed rubric (deterministic axis)

The capability _list_ — not the per-run scores — is what must stay stable so two scans of the same repo are comparable. Persist it per domain in the **scanned repo** at `.sota/rubric.<domain-slug>.json`:

```json
{
  "domain": "git-hook-quality-gate",
  "version": 2,
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "git-hook-install",
      "tier": "table-stakes",
      "test": "installs hooks that fire on commit/push"
    },
    { "id": "changed-files-only", "tier": "table-stakes", "test": "can scope a run to the diff" },
    { "id": "sarif-output", "tier": "edge", "test": "emits SARIF for CI security tab" }
  ]
}
```

- **If a rubric file exists for the detected domain, score against THAT list** (mark each `met` / `partial` / `missing`). This is what makes coverage% and tier reproducible across runs — the axis doesn't drift with the model's mood.
- **If none exists**, derive the list from the Step-1 field scan and write it. If this run's field surfaces a genuinely new table-stakes capability, _add it and bump `version`_ — don't silently re-weight; note the rubric change in the output so a score drop is attributable to a harder bar, not regression.
- "Deterministic" here means a **fixed scoring axis + a diffable record**, not byte-identical output — an LLM run never is. The rubric removes the axis drift; the persisted scan (Step 4) makes the rest auditable.

## Step 3 — Rank the gaps as an actionable to-do list

**Split gaps into four sections — never present them as one flat list.** The clustering in Step 1.5 exists so the gap list is fair; honor it here:

1. **Direct peer gaps** — capabilities our _same-cluster_ peers have that we lack. These are the real, mandatory gaps. `[!]` table-stakes first.
2. **Maturity / quality gaps** — tests, CI, releases, coverage. Quality of the project, not features.
3. **Documentation / onboarding gaps** — docs, examples, quickstart, getting-started UX.
4. **Optional cross-cluster ideas** — a capability that lives in _another_ cluster, surfaced as strategic inspiration. **Mark these "optional / strategic," never as missing table-stakes**, and name the source cluster ("borrowed from the vector-database cluster"). They do **not** count toward the coverage %, the tier, or `gaps_total`.

Only sections 1–3 (table-stakes within them) drive the tier. A cross-cluster idea is never a reason to call the repo "BEHIND."

Each gap is rendered as a card:

```
[!]  #1  <Capability>            table-stakes · effort ~Xd · gap: high · impl: medium
     Why:    <one line — why this matters for THIS repo's goal>
     Study:  <owner/repo → specific file/feature> — source of inspiration (the desired UX)
     Step 1: <first file to create/edit AND first function/command/test to add>
     Verify: <the integration assumption to confirm before committing to that patch — omit only if already verified>
```

- `[!]` = table-stakes gap (do these first), `[~]` = edge gap.
- **Effort** = your rough _estimate_ (`~2h`, `~1d`, `~3d`) so the user can triage — it's a guess, not a cited fact; the `~` signals that. Don't dress it up as precise.
- **Study** is the load-bearing field — a gap without a reference to copy from is just a complaint. But **Study is the source of inspiration, not a verified integration path.** "Repo X shows the UX we want" does not establish that _its specific API is the right thing for us to call._ Confirm the public API is stable and suitable for our use before presenting it as the patch.
- **Step 1 must be patch-oriented, not directional.** Name the first file to create or edit _and_ the first function/command/test to add. ✅ ``create `src/config.rs` with `load_config(path) -> Result<Config>` and wire it into `main.rs` before command dispatch`` — ❌ "create a config loader." The reader should be able to start typing immediately.
- **Don't prescribe an unverified external call as the settled patch.** When Step 1 depends on a third-party API/crate you haven't confirmed is public, stable, and intended for this use, do **not** write it as if it's definitely the right line (❌ confidently emitting `pretty_assertions::Comparison::new(&a, &b)` when you haven't checked that `Comparison` is a stable public API). Instead: state the reference UX, then list 2–3 **implementation options** (A. use the reference's public API if stable enough; B. drop to lower-level crates directly; C. build a local renderer) and put the open question on the `Verify:` line. Prescribe one exact call only when you've confirmed it; otherwise the options + Verify line _are_ the honest patch.
- **Two confidence axes on every card** — keep them separate, because "we clearly lack a thing they clearly have" can pair with "but how to wire it in is unsettled":
  - `gap:` — confidence the gap is real (high = grounded in code/docs on both sides; medium = one side inferred or the table-stakes call is judgement; low = unverified inference dominates).
  - `impl:` — confidence the prescribed integration path is the right one (high = you confirmed the API/approach; medium = inspiration is solid but the exact call is unverified; low = approach is a guess).
  - Add a `needs-verification:` note naming the open question (e.g. "public Comparison/StrComparison API suitability") whenever `impl:` is below high. A real gap with an unsure patch is `gap: high · impl: medium` — not a single blended number that hides which half is soft.
- Order strictly highest-impact first. Cap the rendered **cards** at the top 5, but always print the _true_ total gap count next to the tier (e.g. "BEHIND · 7 table-stakes gaps, top 5 shown") — capping the display must never hide how deep the tier goes, since the worst tier (LAGGING) starts at exactly 5 gaps.

## Step 4 — Persist the run, then diff against last time

A benchmark you can't re-run and compare can't show progress. After building the matrix, write the run to the **scanned repo** at `.sota/last-scan.json` (don't overwrite the rubric file):

```json
{
  "date": "2026-05-31",
  "domains": ["git-hook-quality-gate"],
  "rubric_version": 2,
  "field": [{ "repo": "evilmartians/lefthook", "stars": 8300, "pushed": "2026-05-20" }],
  "matrix": [{ "id": "git-hook-install", "us": "missing", "tier": "table-stakes" }],
  "coverage": { "met": 4, "total": 8, "pct": 50 },
  "tier": "BEHIND",
  "gaps_total": 4
}
```

- **Persist only after every `gh`/web/verification call has returned.** Don't pre-write the file with values you intend to fill in — a scan that writes stars before the `gh` results land will bake in guesses (this is a real, observed failure). Gather first, write once.
- Use **today's date from context** for `date` (don't invent one; if unknown, write `"unknown"`).
- **Before writing, read the previous `.sota/last-scan.json` if it exists** and render a one-line **"Since last scan"** delta at the top of the dashboard: coverage Δ (e.g. `50% → 63%, +1 met`), tier change, capabilities newly **met** or newly **lost**, and competitors **added/dropped** from the field. If the rubric `version` changed between runs, say so — a score move may be the bar moving, not the repo.
- **First run** (no prior file): say "baseline — no prior scan to diff" and just write the file.
- These files belong to the repo being benchmarked (so history travels with it). Mention them in the output so the user can choose to commit or `.gitignore` them.
- **Shareable report (`--report`).** After persisting `last-scan.json`, a standalone Markdown report can be exported with `node scripts/sota-report.mjs --report`, which renders `.sota/report.<domain>.md` (header metadata, summary, the capability matrix, the high-confidence gap list, and a hyperlinked sources/disclosures audit trail) from the persisted scan via the pure `lib/report.mjs` renderer. It is **deterministic** — same `last-scan.json`, byte-identical report — so `node scripts/sota-report.mjs --check` fails if the on-disk report is stale. Run it (or preview to stdout with no flag) when the user wants a shareable artifact beyond the terminal dashboard + JSON.

## Rules — blockers vs. quality

### Hard blockers (violating any one invalidates the scan — fix before output)

- **Read the repo first.** A comparison not grounded in the actual code is a listicle — that's the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.
- **No source, no claim.** A gap row with no URL/repo gets dropped, not guessed.
- **No guessed file paths.** Cite a file only if you confirmed it exists; otherwise cite `owner/repo → <feature name>`.
- **Every "Us" claim is grounded in a repo file.**
- **Every gap is tied to both repo evidence and external evidence.**
- **Stay inside the repo's stated goal.** Don't recommend pivoting the product; recommend closing gaps within what it already aims to be.
- **Cluster broad fields before scoring.** Don't benchmark a focused repo against an undifferentiated set of different methodologies. Score against the repo's own cluster; cross-cluster differences are optional ideas, not gaps. (Degrade to one flat group only when the pool is too thin, and disclose it.)
- If web/git access is unavailable, say so plainly and stop — do not fabricate the field from memory.

### Quality checks (raise the grade; degrade gracefully and disclose if skipped)

- Saturation search (per the mode's requirement).
- Exact GitHub stars via `gh` (fall back to `~` web figures, marked).
- Score against a saved rubric.
- Persisted scan + "since last scan" diff (or read-only fallback).
- Coverage bar + comparator-type tags + confidence labels.
- **Distinguish table-stakes from edge** — flooding the user with edge features they don't need is noise.

## Before you output — self-check (enforce the hard rules)

Run this pass on your own draft. Treat the two groups differently: a failed **blocker** means the output is invalid — fix it before presenting (don't ship and apologize). A failed **quality** check is allowed only if you _disclose_ it in one line; silently skipping it is not.

### Blocker checks — must pass or the output is invalid

1. **Every Reference resolves** to a real repo, and any file path named was actually confirmed (not guessed).
2. **Every gap is verified on both sides** — confirm against a primary source that the competitor _actually has_ it **and** that we _actually lack_ it; re-read the one source that proves it. Drop or mark "unverified" otherwise. **No table-stakes gap rests on a README marketing claim alone** when code/docs could verify it.
3. **Every ✅/⚠️/❌ in the "Us" column names the repo file** that backs it (you read us before reading them).
4. **No gap without a cited source**, and nothing recommends pivoting outside the repo's stated goal.
5. **Field framing is rendered before the matrix** (detected / **cluster** / adjacent / excluded / assumption) — the wrong field invalidates everything below it.
6. **For a broad domain, the field is clustered and the matrix is scored against OUR cluster** — cross-cluster differences appear only as _optional/strategic_ ideas, never as mandatory table-stakes gaps, and never count toward coverage/tier. (If the pool was too thin to cluster, that's disclosed.)

### Quality checks — disclose if skipped or only partially satisfied

7. **The execution mode is stated**, and its comparator/saturation budget was honored — searched to saturation for `standard`/`exhaustive`, or early stop disclosed for `quick`.
8. **Every star/recency figure has a source** — exact via `gh`, or marked `~` if web-scraped; stale/archived comparators flagged, not treated as the bar.
9. **Scored against the saved rubric** if one exists (axis didn't drift); a new/bumped rubric version is disclosed.
10. **Coverage math checks out:** bar is 10 segments, fill = round(pct/10), label shows real `met/total`; **tier matches the gap count** and the true total is shown even if cards are capped at 5.
11. **The run was persisted** to `.sota/last-scan.json` — written _once, after_ all `gh`/web calls returned — with a "Since last scan" line (or baseline note); or, if read-only, rendered as copyable JSON marked "not written."
12. **Each leaderboard row has a comparator type**, and inclusion is justified by type — not stars alone.
13. **Every gap card carries both confidence axes** (`gap:` and `impl:`), the #1 task names a concrete file + function/command/test (patch-oriented, not directional), and **no unverified external API is prescribed as the settled patch** — where the integration path is unconfirmed, `impl:` is below high, a `needs-verification:` note names the open question, and Step 1 offers options rather than one over-specific call.
14. **The benchmark-selection audit trail is shown** (clusters found · direct comparators · broader references · excluded) so the user can challenge _why_ these repos were the comparison set; gaps are split into the four sections (direct-peer / maturity / onboarding / cross-cluster).

### Presentation rules

- **Coverage bar** is always **10 segments wide regardless of how many table-stakes you found.** Compute `pct = round(met / total × 100)`; fill `round(pct / 10)` segments with `█` and the rest with `░`. The label shows the _real_ fraction `(met/total table-stakes met)` — NOT `met/10`. Example: 4 of 8 met → `█████░░░░░ 50% (4/8 table-stakes met)`. The bar is the at-a-glance "how far behind" signal; the label keeps it honest when total ≠ 10.
- **Emoji are status, not decoration.** `[!]`/🔴 = table-stakes gap, `[~]`/🟡 = edge, ✅ = matched. Don't sprinkle others.
- **Tier rule (gaps = table-stakes capabilities you're MISSING or only ⚠️ partial):** FRONTIER = 0 gaps · COMPETITIVE = 1–2 · BEHIND = 3–4 · LAGGING = 5+. Tier is an absolute gap count, so always show it alongside the coverage % — a wide field can read "BEHIND" at a healthy-looking 67%. If the two seem to disagree, that's expected; name both, don't reconcile by fudging.
- **One screen to the verdict.** Verdict + Do-this-next + coverage must fit before any table. If the matrix is long, the user has already gotten the actionable part.
- Keep the whole thing skimmable — a busy maintainer should grasp standing + next action in under 15 seconds.
